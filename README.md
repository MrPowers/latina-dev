#Latina-Dev

Women held 57% of all professional occupations, yet they held only 25% of all computing occupations. And the numbers are even lower when considering women from a different ethnicity; Latinas hold only 1% and of these jobs.

##Mision

Our mission is to empower more Latina Women to learn programming, so the gender and ethnicity gap can be dramatically reduced. 


Diversity leads to better products and results. According to an MIT study, diversity in workplaces improves performance, morale and the end product. And by reducing the gender and ethnicity gap, the companies can benefit from innovation, problem-solving, and creativity. Indeed, a solid body of research in computing and in other
fields documents the enhanced performance outcomes and benefits brought about by diverse work teams.

If there are more women engineers, companies can build better teams and better software. Not only that, women who code can be examples to millions of girls to show them programming is something they can do.
